# ExcelScript-for-Finding-and-Highlighting-Ukrainian-Names-and-Surnames
 This project features an ExcelScript that checks a range of cells in Excel for Ukrainian names and surnames. When a match is found, the script highlights the cell in yellow, helping to quickly identify and process Ukrainian name lists. Key features include predefined name search, highlighting matches, and outputting the total matches found.
